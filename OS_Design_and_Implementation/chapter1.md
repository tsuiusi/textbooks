# Chapter 1 notes

* Apps -> System programs (compilers, editors, command interpreter) -> OS -> Machine code -> Microarchitecture (CPU,  ALU, etc) -> Physical devices
* Instructions + hardware = Instruction set architecture (ISA), or *machine language*
* An OS abstracts away the details of moving data, finding heads, etc for the programmer
* OS typically runs in **kernel mode** or **supervisor mode** to prevent users tampering with hardware

> the OS can be seen as an extension of the computer, or as a resource allocator (generally both makes sense)

Multiprogramming: partitioning memory to handle multiple jobs at the same time

## History of computing/OS: PC generation
* Microprocessor based
* 8080: first general purpose 8-bit microprocessor
* 6502: CPU of early systems, most notably the Apple II
* Doug Engelbart: invented GUI

## MINIX 3
* Modded UNIX - OS that's compatible with UNIX, but different internally
* Mini UNIX
* Spawned Linux

Processes:
* Program execution
* Each process is associated with an **address space**, a list of memory locations which the process can rw
* Child processes -> tree structure; related processes require cooperation and synchronization
* After *n* seconds the OS sends an alamr signal to the process, causes temporary halting and saving registers on the stack
* Signals are the software analog of hardware analogs


Files:
* Directory structure
* Very familiar with trees after my job :)
* (this is more a thing with the fact that it's old but interesting regardless) MINIX 3 allows CD-ROMs to attach their file system to the main file tree
* Special files: 
    * **Block special files**: used to model devices that consist of a collection of randomly addressable blocks (e.g disks)
    * If you open a block special file and read a block, the program can access that block without regard to the file system contained within
    * **Character special files**: model printers, modems, devices that IO character streams. kept in /dev by convention.

Shell
* "makes heavy use of many OS features and thus serves as a good example of how the system calls can be used."
* sh -> csh, ksh, zsh, bash
* Just read about UNIX bro ~ Tanenbaum 


### System calls
* Interface between applications and the OS
* POSIX = set of standards 
* Whenever a program wants to do something (e.g move a file) it makes a system call
* The OS figures out what the program wants by inspecting the parameters, carries out the call, and return control to the instruction following the call
* Only system calls enter the kernel or other privileged OS components and procedure calls don't
* MINIX 3 has 53 main system calls

System calls for process management:
* Fork is the only way to create a new process, and it creates an identical copy that diverges the moment they split
* Fork call returns a value - zero in child and the child's process identifier (**PID**)
* Since most child processes are run synchronously with their parents the parents execute a **waitpid** system call to wait for the child to terminate
    * when it's done the address pointed to by the second parameter, **statloc** will be set to the child's exit status 
* execve is used to execute the user command

```
/* this code demonstrates how fork, waitpid, and execve can be used */
#define TRUE 1

while (TRUE) {
    type_prompt();
    read_command(command, parameters);

    if (fork() != 0) {
        waitpid(-1,&status, 0);
    } else {
        execve(command, paramters, 0);
    }
}
``` 
For some reason the processes are usually forked:
* Creates a child process, so the command can be executed in a process separate to the shell's process
* Preserves the shell's state
* Concurrency
* Resource managed better
* That's the reason that commands such as (cp file1 file2) are forked 

### Main system calls of MINIX:
![system calls](systemcalls.png) 

Programs of system calls:
* use the declaration main(argc, argv, envp)
* argc counts the no. arguments
* argv is a pointer to an array containing the strings inputted in the command
* envp is a pointer to the environment, pass information of the env (e.g terminal type, home directory) to the program
* & is used to obtain the memory location - e.g n = waitpid(âˆ’1, &statloc, options); the &statloc provides the memory address of the statloc variable to waitpid()

Processes:
* 3 segments: text, data, and stack
* Data goes up, stack goes down, gap is unused address space
* Stack grows into gap automatically, expansion of data is done explicitly by a system call **brk** which specifies the new address where the data segment is to end.
* Stack and data cannot overlap
* sbrk does the same thing but changes the size of the data segment - it keeps track of the current size, getting the new size, and making a call for that many bytes

System calls for signalling
* To handle unexpected communications (e.g interrupts (CTRL-C) to halt programs)
* Interrupts to make sure a program does something (e.g retransmit lost packets over a network)
* Also processes that get activated by signals

### System calls for file management:
* For some reason named creat and not create
* Parameters provide name of file and protection mode (e.g `fd = creat("filename", 0751)`)
* Mode = flags that determine the perms and access for the file
* Octal notation = 3 digit number - [0] represents permissions for the owner, [1] represents the permissions for the group associated, [2] represents the permissions of everyone else
* Special files are called with mknod(path, octal, major device) instead
* Read and write have various modes (like the Google Drive API)
* Some programs need to be able to access any part of a file at random; **lseek** used for that purpose

|Digit | Permissions|
|-|-|
|0 (000 in binary)| No permissions|
|1 (001 in binary)| Execute permission|
|2 (010 in binary)| Write permission|
|3 (011 in binary)| Write and execute permissions|
|4 (100 in binary)| Read permission|
|5 (101 in binary)| Read and execute permissions|
|6 (110 in binary)| Read and write permissions|
|7 (111 in binary)| Read, write, and execute permissions|

0751 means the owner has full permissions, the group associated can read and execute it, and everyone else can execute it

Terminal modes:
* Cooked, raw and cbreak
* Cooked = normal model, erase and kill characters work normally, CTRL commands work as usual
* Raw = all commands disabled; displays all the characters that have been typed and not just completed lines, used for visual editors
* cbreak = in between; kill and erase characters for editing are disabled but CTRL commands work
* In POSIX, canonical mode = cooked mode; in noncanonical mode the input is not processed line by line but the program can specify a minimum no. characters to accept or a timeout before satisfying a read request 
    * Read request is the system call to read a file

### System calls for directory management:
* Relating directories/file system as a whole
* mkdir and rmdir falls under this category
* **link** allows the same file to appear under 2 or more names, in different directories. Usually used by programming teams.
    * Every file has a unique i-number identifier
    * If you ` link("dir/a/file.file", "dir/b/filename.file") `, you get both file.file and filename.file linking to the same file 
    * Like a fortnite skin - skin changes, player stays the same

So what's in an OS?:
* File manager
* Shell
* Process handling
* Networking
