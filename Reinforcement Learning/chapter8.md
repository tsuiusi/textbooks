# Chapter 8: Planning and Learning with Tabular Methods
> 

### Definitions
* Model: anything an agent can use to predict how the environment will respond to its actions
    * Can be distribution based or sample based; much easier to obtain sample-based (less values needed ot be predicted)
    * Distribution: all possible sums of everything and the probabilities of occurence
    * Sample: individual prediction of what's going to happen
* Planning: any computational process that takes a model as an input and produces/improves a policcy for interacting with the modeled environment
