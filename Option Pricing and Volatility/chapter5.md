# Chapter 5: Using an Option's Theoretical Value
> Performance above all - how it works, what it's inputs are, whatever, doesn't matter; what matters is if it makes money or not

The Black-Scholes model solves the problem of predicting a value with relatively few inputs and simple math operations.

To see how a model performs, we first make two assumptions:
1. If the price distribution of the UC is accurately represented by the lognormal distribution
2. We actually know the future volatility of an UC

(these assumptions are completely improbable) but hypothetically if they were, we'd be able to profit off of any difference between the theoretical value and actual price.

Suppose a ser
