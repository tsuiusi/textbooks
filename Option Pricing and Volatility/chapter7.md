# Chapter 7: Introduction to Spreading
> mmmmmfghh 
> just a gamble on mean regression

Spreading essentially bets on the direction in which the UC will move.
* Directional approach often isn't the best case
* More than option price to consider
* Very probability/stats based, often over longer time periods

> "Spreading is simply a way of enabling an option trader to take advantage of theoretically mispriced options, while at the same time reducing the effects of short term changes in market conditions so that he can safely hold an option position to maturity."

## Spread 
A spread is a strategy that involves taking simultaneous but opposing positions in different instruments. 
1. Identify price relationship between two instruments
2. When the ratio becomes different from what it's usually been, sell the overpriced one (buy puts?) and buy the underpriced one; wait until it returns
3. Sell when it does

Often the prices fluctuate merely because the delivery months are different (e.g crops during summer, oil during winter) and the 

### Carrying cost
* Dividends, interest rates, etc
* Money is lost via interest rates; again foreign currencies are different

### Spreading it
* Spreads don't need to be based on the different delivery months of the same commodity, they can be of anything as long as there is a relationship between the two.
* Volatility changes/spreads can also be capitalized upon; it influences an option's price.
* Spread is just a gamble on mean regression

Spreads can both be static and dynamic, like how the mispriced option was taken advantage of in chapter 5. 

## Why Spread?
* When you're holding a position, short term fluctuations might bankrupt you
* You want to maintain the position because you're pretty sure it'll make you money
* If you're forced to liquidate prematurely, then you can't profit + you might lose money

Spreading takes advantage of probability (mean regression) so the trader can hold for longer and protects the trader from incorrectly estimated inputs into the pricing model (e.g BS).

### Example
* Deutschmark is trading at 13%, call has theoretical value of 1.75 and is trading at 2
* Delta is 25

Strategy: buy 4 calls at 2.00 each and buy one futures contract, getting an edge of 1.00 point (or 1250 - each point is 1250)
* Why not do this 40 times for 12500? Why not 40 million? 
* Because he might be wrong and it'll ruin him
* All in all the time? 

## Spreading for Risk Management
Roulette example:
* I put 2000 on 16. It's a nice number, I'm lucky, I'll get the 72000 payoff. But I might not. The casino has a risk of 70000 (2000 cost of the bet)
* So you come here and put 1000 on another number. Your mom also shows up, and puts 1000 on a third number. Now the casino has a risk of 34000.
* The edge to the casino is still 5% in both cases, and in the long run, that's true - they get to keep ~5% of everything that's on the table
* However, as I've got absolute luck, the 70000 loss might ruin them on the short term. You keep winning if you stay alive, but once you're out, it's hard to get back in.
* The bigger the trade, the bigger the payoff.

Experienced traders always spread the risk off via options, futures, contracts, bonds, or some permutation of these instruments. They have more items available, only unlocked through leveling up. It's like how you can't fish legendaries in stardew without level 10 fishing (most of them, anyway).
